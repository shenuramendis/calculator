# Calculator

This is a simple calculator built in Python 3.14, which first converts the user input (infix) to a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression. 

The expression is converted using a shunting-yard algorithm and is then evaluated.

## Operations

The program currently supports five operations, which can be found in [operations.py](rpn_calc/operations.py)
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exponentiation (^)

## Running the program

To run the program, download the [rpn_calc](rpn_calc/) folder, and run [calculator.py](rpn_calc/calculator.py) in the terminal.
